# Resizable

Provides a flexible system for creating resizable panel layouts. Supports horizontal and vertical stacking, collapsible panels, and drag-and-drop reordering, making it easy to build complex, adjustable interfaces.


## Basic Usage

You can use the `Resizable` component directly with a `panels` prop for a config-driven approach.

<ComponentPreview name='Resizable-Examples' />


## Collapsible Panels

Panels can be made collapsible when resized beyond a certain threshold.

<ComponentPreview name='Resizable-Collapsible' />

## Nested Layouts

Resizable groups can be nested to create complex layouts.

<ComponentPreview name='Resizable-NestedLayout' />

## Reorderable Panels

Panels can be reordered by dragging and dropping them.

<ComponentPreview name='Resizable-Reorderable' />

## Custom Container Slot

You can provide a custom container for the resizable groups.

<ComponentPreview name='Resizable-CustomContainer' />
